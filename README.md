Hello World ,

I am Gopal, born in India, currently living in Atlanta, Georgia, with my sweet wife and son.

Gopal literally translated in any Indian laguages, means a Cowboy, one who takes care of cows, but I have come to accept myself as handyman, as I naturally enjoy  fixing broken things, such as broken equipment at home, broken toys, broken software and my broken self. 

All my working life since 1998, I have worked as oracle database developer and now as Oracle APEX Developer at LANL Corp. 

I have solved many problems related to my work, mainly by searching the internet and then applying the information to solve the problem and finally taking the credit. 

I owe the internet community for being my endless source of support and ideas and have a feeling of restlessness to give back and be debt free if thats possible.

So one day when hiking a trail on Arabia Mountain near Atlanta, Georgia, this idea came to my mind. Not a original one, but I felt committed to it.

I have been a consumer, all my life, I want to be a producer now, who produces **positive content**,
which may help my fellows on internet in some way. 

I have some definite goals I want to achieve in this life

- Learn to love and forgive effortlessly by actively working on myself to be a loving husband, father, son, friend and acquaintance. I have realized that, love is not a feeling, it is a deliberate act of not blaming anyone by exercising empathy and accepting the outcome as it is.
- Write stories and possibly make a TV series for kids revealing the philosophical mysteries of life
- Contribute something significant in world of Einstiens physics, related to time.
- Write software for solving important problems faced by life forms on this spaceship earth.
