Hello World ,

I am Gopal, born in India, currently living in Atlanta, Georgia, with my sweet wife and son.

Gopal literally translated in any Indian laguages, means a Cowboy, but I have come to accept myself as handyman, as I naturally enjoy fixing broken things.

Since 1998, I have worked as Oracle database developer and I am currently working as Oracle APEX Developer at LANL. 

I have solved many problems related to my work, mainly by searching the internet and then applying the information to solve the problem and finally taking the credit. 

I owe the internet community for being my endless source of support and have a feeling of restlessness to give back.

One day when hiking a trail on Arabia Mountain near Atlanta, Georgia, this idea came to my mind. Not a original one, but I felt committed to it.

I have been a consumer, all my life, I want to be a producer now, who produces **positive content**, and I hope my contributions at github, helps you in some way.

Thank you for reading !
