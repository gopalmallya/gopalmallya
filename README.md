Hello World ,

I am Gopal, born in India, currently living in Atlanta, Georgia, with my sweet wife and son.

Gopal literally translated in any Indian laguages, means a Cowboy, one who takes care of cows, but I have come to accept myself as handyman, as I naturally enjoy  fixing broken things, such as broken equipment at home, broken toys, broken software and my broken self. 

All my working life, I have worked as oracle database developer and now as Sr APEX Developer at Oracle Corp. 

I have solved many problems related to my work, mainly by searching the internet and then applying the information to solve the problem and finally taking the credit. 

I owe the internet community for being my endless source of support and ideas and have a feeling of restlessness to give back and be debt free if thats possible.

So one day when hiking a trail on Arabia Mountain near Atlanta, Georgia, this idea came to my mind. Not a original one, but I felt committed to it.

I have been a consumer, all my life, I want to be a producer now, who produces **positive content**,
which may help my fellows on internet in some way. 

My first project, csv2table, solves the problem of uploading large csv datasets and is meant to help Oracle APEX developers to get past the uploading problem. This was easy to start and complete.

My next project will be to write an Essay, which I dont find many in these days of blogging and tweeting, where someone has to (quoting Paul RIchard on substantive writing) **say something worth saying about something worth saying something about**.
